This is not a game made by ZUN, nor is it affiliated to Team Shanghai Alice. Any matchings to the real world are complete coincidences and this story is all fiction. Thank you for playing!<br><br><br><br><br>■２．Prologue<br><br><br>-- Gensokyo, the closed-off land where that which has passed into fantasy travels to.<br><br><br>Usually a place filled with sights to behold, there was something disrupting its natural beauty.<br><br><br>-- The Hakurei Shrine<br><br><br>There, a fairy dressed in striped clothing that resembles a flag from a foreign country stood, staring into the sun, almost motionless.<br><br><br>Reimu "Hey, Clownpiece, stop doing that, you'll go blind."<br><br><br>The fairy snapped out of her trance-like state.<br><br><br>Clownpiece "Oh, sorry Reimu, I don't know what came over me."<br><br><br>With that, the fairy ran back to behind the shrine. Just then, a blonde-haired girl dressed in a stereotypical witch's clothing walked up.<br><br><br>Marisa "Yo, Reimu, any idea what the hell that was about?"<br>Reimu "I don't even know... lately all the fairies have been staring at the sun."<br>Marisa "Ha, isn't that just regular fairy things?"<br>Reimu "Not really, considering they don't even appear aware of their surroundings until someone snaps out of it."<br>Reimu "I bet Clownpiece would've gone blind if I hadn't stopped her."<br>Marisa "Huh... weird."<br>Marisa "All the trees in the Forest of Magic have been rotting, too."<br>Reimu "Isn't that something all trees do?"<br>Marisa "No, you don't understand. I've lived in the Forest of Magic for a while now, the trees *never* rot. Something has to be up."<br>Marisa "Oh, and that's not all. Watch."<br><br><br>Marisa took out her mini-hakkero. It then proceeded to emit an extremely large laser that threatened to demolish anything in its path, which in this case turned out to be the Hakurei Shrine.<br><br><br>Reimu "(angry) Hey Marisa, you could've warned me that you were going to Master Spark my shrine away, did that not come to mind?"<br>Marisa "That wasn't a Master Spark"<br><br><br>Reimu blinked<br><br><br>Marisa "That was *supposed* to be my regular illusion laser. I swear, something's messin' up my trusty Hakkero."<br>Marisa "Even my missiles are messed up, they home in on any enemy as if it were like your funky amulet things."<br>Reimu "Yeah, but did you have to demonstrate that on my own shrine?"<br>??? "What happened here?"<br><br><br>Just then, a self-proclaimed hermit that usually resides within the mountains showed up.<br><br><br>Marisa "Oh, hey Kasen. This is just the, uhhh, fourth? Yeah I think it's the fourth incident that Reimu's shrine got destroyed because of."<br>Reimu "Don't say that as if it's your fault."<br><br><br>Just then, Reimu noticed a strange beverage in Kasen's hand, one which she recognized.<br><br><br>Reimu "Kasen... what is that."<br>Kasen "Oh, it's boba tea."<br>Reimu "How did you get ahold of that, didn't that weird outside world invasion thing get resolved already?"<br>Kasen "Yes. I actually came here to warn you about something.<br>Kasen "The Hakurei barrier is weakening. I was able to cross it to get this, something which should normally be impossible unless I wanted to cause a cataclysmic amount of damage somewhere."<br>Kasen "There's some weird energy influx that's causing this, some people are able to cross the barrier like it's nothing. I bet you it's just a matter of time before the barrier is completely gone."<br><br><br>Reimu just stood there processing this for a while.<br><br><br>Reimu "First the Urban Legend Incident, then the thing with the Snow Lotuses, and now this? How many people want to destroy the barrier?"<br>Reimu "Okay, I'm heading off to solve this. Marisa, you coming with?"<br>Marisa "Oh, well uh..."<br><br><br>Marisa proceeded to show Reimu a pile of wooden flakes that was kept in her pocket.<br><br><br>Marisa "This energy influx caused my broomstick to explode."<br><br><br>Kasen and Reimu stared at this for a bit before breaking out into laughter.<br><br><br>Marisa "It's not funny!"<br>Reimu "Your broomstick exploded? Because of the incident? That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard."<br><br><br>Regaining her composure, Kasen spoke up.<br><br><br>Kasen "Reimu, it's best that you set off to find the mastermind before it gets too late."<br>Reimu "Ah, okay. Marisa, stay here, don't try to do anything reckless. I've got this covered."<br><br><br>Thus, the Hakurei shrine maiden set off, still finding it difficult to maintain a straight face. Marisa got up and walked away, too.<br><br><br>Kasen "Didn't Reimu tell you to stay here and not do anything?"<br>Marisa "Oh, relax, I'm just gonna go bother Alice real quickly, I'll be back soon."<br>Kasen "...if you say so."<br><br><br>---<br><br><br>In a lab, somewhere, a device whirred off endlessly, spewing out pure energy that would soon overload all of Gensokyo. Next to it, a girl stood, smiling out of excitement.<br>Soon, she would no longer be trapped.<br>Soon, she would be able to free herself.<br><br><br>Soon, she would finally be able to return home.<br><br><br><br><br>■３．Install<br><br><br> Just run the game executable, and enjoy.
